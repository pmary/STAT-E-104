The variance is the expectation of the squared [deviation](/standard-deviation.md) of a random variable from its [mean](/second-question.md). It measures how far a set of numbers are spreads out from their average value.

The variance is the square of the [standard deviation](/standard-deviation.md), the second central moment of a distribution, and covariance of the random variable with itself.
