The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often.

In a distribution chart, the mode is the range that occurred with the highest frequency.

In the case of a uniform distribution, there is no mode because all the values are the same.

Distributions are considered multimodal when they have more than one clear trend. In the following example, there is two modes at 7 and 9. Why? Because a lot of female have size 7 foot and a lot of males have size 9, making this a bi-modal distribution.![](/assets/multi-modal-distribution.jpg)The data doesn't need to be numeric to find a mode. We can also compute the mode for categorical data as well. In the following chart, the mode is "Plain". Remember, on a chart, the mode is always on the X-axis.![](/assets/non-numerical-mode.jpg)
