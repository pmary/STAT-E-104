The sample \(or Ã©chantillon in French\), is a set of data collected/selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure. The elements of the sample are known as sample points, sampling units or observations.

Making a complete enumeration of all the values in the population is either impractical or impossible. The sample usually represents a subset of manageable size. Statistics are calculated from the sample so that one can make inferences or extrapolations from the sample to the population.
