In probability and statistics, population mean is a synonym of "expected value". It refer to one measure of the [central tendency](/central-tendency.md) either of a [probability distribution](/probability-distribution.md) or of the random variable characterized by that distribution.

To calculate the mean of a list of number, you divide the sum the number of values: $$\bar{x} = \frac{x_\textrm{1} + x_\textrm{2} + ... + x_\textrm{n}} {n}$$

### Mathematical representation

$$\bar{x}$$ \(pronounce, x bar\)
